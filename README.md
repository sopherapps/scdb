# scdb

![CI](https://github.com/sopherapps/scdb/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

A very simple and fast key-value store but persisting data to disk, with a "localStorage-like" API.

**scdb is not yet production ready. It is not even working yet!!. It is still being heavily developed and its API (and
features) could change quite
drastically**

## Purpose

Coming from front-end web
development, [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) was always
a convenient way of quickly persisting data to be used later by a given application even after a restart.
Its API was extremely simple i.e. `localStorage.getItem()`, `localStorage.setItem()`, `localStorage.removeItem()`
, `localStorage.clear()`.

Coming to the backend (or even desktop) development, such an embedded persistent data store with a simple API
was hard to come by.

scdb is meant to be like the 'localStorage' of backend and desktop (and possibly mobile) systems.
Of course to make it a little more appealing, it has some extra features like:

- Time-to-live (TTL) where a key-value pair expires after a given time
- Non-blocking reads from separate processes, and threads.
- Fast Sequential writes to the store, queueing any writes from multiple processes and threads.

## Quick Start

- Create a new cargo project

  ```shell
  cargo new hello_scdb && cd hello_scdb
  ```

- Add scdb to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml` file

  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  scdb = { git = "https://github.com/sopherapps/scdb", branch = "master" }
  ```

- Update your `src/main.rs` to the following.

  ```rust
  use scdb::Store;
  use std::thread;
  use std::time::Duration;
  
  /// Prints data from store to the screen in a pretty way
  macro_rules! pprint_data {
      ($title:expr, $data:expr) => {
          println!("\n");
          println!("{}", $title);
          println!("===============");
  
          for (k, got) in $data {
              let got_str = match got {
                  None => "None",
                  Some(v) => std::str::from_utf8(v).expect("bytes to str"),
              };
              println!("For key: '{}', str: '{}', raw: '{:?}',", k, got_str, got);
          }
      };
  }
  
  fn main() {
      // Creat the store. You can configure its `max_keys`, `redundant_blocks` etc. The defaults are usable though.
      // One very important config is `max_keys`. With it, you can limit the store size to a number of keys.
      // By default, the limit is 1 million keys
      let mut store =
          Store::new("db", Some(1000), Some(1), Some(10), Some(1800)).expect("create store");
      let records = [
          ("hey", "English"),
          ("hi", "English"),
          ("salut", "French"),
          ("bonjour", "French"),
          ("hola", "Spanish"),
          ("oi", "Portuguese"),
          ("mulimuta", "Runyoro"),
      ];
      let updates = [
          ("hey", "Jane"),
          ("hi", "John"),
          ("hola", "Santos"),
          ("oi", "Ronaldo"),
          ("mulimuta", "Aliguma"),
      ];
      let keys: Vec<&str> = records.iter().map(|(k, _)| *k).collect();
  
      // Setting the values
      println!("Let's insert data\n{:?}]...", &records);
      for (k, v) in &records {
          let _ = store.set(k.as_bytes(), v.as_bytes(), None);
      }
  
      // Getting the values (this is similar to what is in `get_all(&mut store, &keys)` function
      let data: Vec<(&str, Option<Vec<u8>>)> = keys
          .iter()
          .map(|k| (*k, store.get(k.as_bytes()).expect(&format!("get {}", k))))
          .collect();
      pprint_data!("After inserting data", &data);
  
      // Setting the values with time-to-live
      println!(
          "\n\nLet's insert data with 1 second time-to-live (ttl) for keys {:?}]...",
          &keys[3..]
      );
      for (k, v) in &records[3..] {
          let _ = store.set(k.as_bytes(), v.as_bytes(), Some(1));
      }
  
      println!("We will wait for 1 second to elapse...");
      thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
  
      let data = get_all(&mut store, &keys);
      pprint_data!("After inserting keys with ttl", &data);
  
      // Updating the values
      println!("\n\nLet's update with data {:?}]...", &updates);
      for (k, v) in &updates {
          let _ = store.set(k.as_bytes(), v.as_bytes(), None);
      }
  
      let data = get_all(&mut store, &keys);
      pprint_data!("After updating keys", &data);
  
      // Deleting some values
      let keys_to_delete = ["oi", "hi"];
      println!("\n\nLet's delete keys{:?}]...", &keys_to_delete);
      for k in keys_to_delete {
          store
              .delete(k.as_bytes())
              .expect(&format!("delete key {}", k));
      }
  
      let data = get_all(&mut store, &keys);
      pprint_data!("After deleting keys", &data);
  
      // Deleting all values
      println!("\n\nClear all data...");
      store.clear().expect("clear store");
  
      let data = get_all(&mut store, &keys);
      pprint_data!("After clearing", &data);
  }
  
  /// Gets all from store for the given keys
  fn get_all<'a>(store: &mut Store, keys: &Vec<&'a str>) -> Vec<(&'a str, Option<Vec<u8>>)> {
      keys.iter()
          .map(|k| (*k, store.get(k.as_bytes()).expect(&format!("get {}", k))))
          .collect()
  }
  ```

## Acknowledgement

- Inspiration was got from [lmdb](https://www.symas.com/lmdb/technical), especially in regard to memory-mapped
  files. That is until I ran into issues with memory-mapped files...For more details, look
  at [this paper by Andrew Crotty, Viktor Leis and Andy Pavlo](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/mmap-cidr2022/).
- A few ideas were picked from [redis](https://redis.io/) and [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) especially to
  do with the database file format.
